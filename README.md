chan.boards(function(err, boards){
	// boards is an array
});

var random = chan.board('b');

random.catalog(function(err, pages){
	// catalog returns all pages from a board
	// but the list of threads only contains the OP
});

random.page(1, function(err, threads){
	// this will return an array of threads
});

random.threads(function(err, threads){
	// this is the same as catalog
	// but shows only thread ids
});

random.thread(495627174, null, function(err, posts){
	// if you have a last-modified timestamp from a
	// previous fetch, use that instead of null to get
	// all posts which have changed since then.
	// this will return an object with the last modified
	// timestamp, a status and an array of posts
});

// sugar for getting an image url from a filename in a post
var img = random.image("somefile.jpeg");
```
